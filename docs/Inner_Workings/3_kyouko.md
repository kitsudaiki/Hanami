# Core

## Retrospect

Before this project grows into the AI-as-a-Service, which it is now, Kyouko was the only component. The primary goal at this point was, to create a network, which is closer to the real functionality of the brain, then the classical deep-learning-networks. 

The first working PoC was at the beginning of 2019 was an exaggerated version. It was the result of a try-and-error-process. Extreme dynamic, but horribly slow with very high memory consumption. Additionally it required manually input and was hard to handle, which made it impossible to train more then a few single values. Interesting as PoC, but from practical perspective totally useless.

In the further development the dynamic was massively reduced in order to increase the performance and reduce memory-usage. It was a fight between the concept and the restrictions of compute-hardware. Additional some optional features were removed, to focus more on the base. The primary target was to bring the network to a state, where it can automatically train the whole MNIST-set in a suitable time. The first version, which was able to do this, took 15min to train the 60000 images and had a test-result of 30-50% correctness, which was also horrible. After many more optimization and fixing, it now need only a few seconds for learning and reach up to 97%.

In this process were also 2 attempts in the past to bring this on a GPU with OpenCL. The results were slower, then on CPU. Because of this, the GPU-support was removed, to focus on CPU for now. 

## Basic internal structure

This is a short overview of the actual Inner_Workings.

![Workflow-library](../img/Kyouko_base.drawio)

The graphic shows a simple Cluster. Clusters consists of multiple Segment-types:

- **Input-Segments**: The gateway for the data into the network.
- **Output-Segments**: Post-processing of data and forwarding them to the output.
- **Core-Segments**: Consists of Bricks (Hexagons in the graphic), which holding the artificial neurons and synapses. Futher infos see [below](/Inner_Workings/3_kyouko/#core-segment).

Segments have a fixed connection between each other and each segment is only processed by one cpu-thread at the same time, but different segments can be processed by different CPU-threads at the same time, as long as they don't depend on each other. Each segment has in input- and output-buffer, to share data with the connected segments. The size of these buffers is fixed. Older versions had flexible buffers, which were too slow. 

Even a segment consists of multiple different data-types (arrays of different types, configurations, etc.), each segment is in memory only one single binary-object, which can simply be written from the memory to the disc, without serialization. When reading a checkpoint of a segment into the memory again, only the pointers within the structure have to be re-initialized.

!!! warning

    It is intended, that a Cluster can have multiple input-, output- and core-segments. But the actual implementation only supports one single input- and output-segment per cluster at the moment and multiple core-clusters care not tested at the moment, as long as ther is only a single input. Comes with version 0.3.0.

### Input-Segment

Input-segments are quite boring. In older versions, they had functionality to normalize data, which is not necessary now. At the moment they only take input-data and push them into the output-buffer of the segment, in order to forward them to the next core-segment.

### Core-Segment

Core-Segments are obviously the main-part of the structure. 

#### Brick-processing

![Workflow-library](../img/Kyouko_node_processing.drawio)

Internally it is structured into Bricks. These are again only a name for a logical structuring for a more effective workflow and resource-handling. The named like this, because the are connected to each other like classical LEGO-bricks. Each Brick contains, based on its configuration, up to 2^16-1 artificial neurons. The reason for this limitation is performance and memory-consumption. Based on its [activation-function](/Inner_Workings/3_kyouko/#activation-function) they are only active, when the input is positive. Otherwise they are skipped. In case that the input comes from an Input-Segment, the activation-functions isn't used. Instead the data are used plain. Connected to the neurons are a chain of synapse-sections. These structs, which hold multiple synapses and are bounded to a brick. Which brick is decided random when creating the section, based on a list of possible target-bricks, based on the location. The input coming from the neuron runs through the synapses one after another and becomes weaker by each passed synapse. The synapses, which are passed and triggered, do again trigger the connected neuron within the Brick. The initial settings of new synapses, like the weakening-effect, are set quite random within some restrictions. At the end of the section, it can go to the next section in another Brick. If a signal still exist at the end of all existing synapses of the chain, then new one will be created. If the input-signal disappear because of the weakening-effect before it reaches the end, then the last synapses of the chain are not processed and have NO effect on their connected neurons. 

This chain is only processed, if the input of a neuron is greater then 0. The input coming from the neuron has basically no upper limit. The bigger the input, the bigger the weakening-effect of new created synapses. 

Synapses can not only create or adjusted, but also deleted again for various reasons. One reason is a activation-counter. If a synapse is not used at least 100 time (hard-coded at the moment), then it becomes weaker and will eventually deleted again. So you could say the network can basically forget things again, if it wasn't learned enough. With the MNIST-Dataset with its 60000 images, which effect not really triggered and tables in form of CSV are not long enough implemented to find the time to test this feature better

!!! info
    
    The hole thing is still quite experimental and at the moment also limited because of some hard-coded restrictions. The implemented base-structure also allows 3-dimensional constructs of bricks, but this is not supported by the input and not tested. Will be further evaluated while working on version `0.3.0`.

#### Activation-function

The activation-function of the neurons doesn't use the classical sigmoid function. The requirements of a function for this part were:

1. only active for input greater `0`
2. no hard upper limit at `1`, like it is the case for the sigmoid function

The following function was selected based on these criteria:

![Workflow-library](../img/central_segment_graph.png)



### Output-Segment

Output-Segments are similar to the Input-Segments.

![Workflow-library](../img/Kyouko_output_segment.drawio)

They have like the Input-Segments a 1:1 connection between in output-nodes and the segment-buffer. In additional they normalize the outgoing values to the range of 0.0-1.0 with the help of the classical sigmoid function:

![Workflow-library](../img/output_segment_function.png)

![Workflow-library](../img/output_segment_graph.png)

The `x` are the values coming from the segment-buffer and the `f(x)` is the output of the network.

## Templates

At the moment the order and configuration of the Bricks and Segments of a Cluster are defined by strings in json-format. 


### Segment-Templates

```
version: 1
segment_type: dynamic_segment
settings:
    max_synapse_sections: 100000
    sign_neg: 0.5
        
bricks:
    1,1,1
        input: test_input
        number_of_neurons: 20
    2,1,1
        number_of_neurons: 10
    3,1,1
        output: test_output
        number_of_neurons: 5
```

#### Bricks

The `bricks` defining, which the bricks are ordered within the segment. 

- `input` and `output` defining, if the brick works as input of output for the segment. This type-identifier is followed by a name, which is later used to identify the brick while connecting the segments in the [Cluster-templates](/internal/3_kyouko/#cluster-templates).

- positions like `1,1,1` defining with `x`, `y` and `z` value the position of the brick within the segment. In this example, it only defines a row of 3 bricks. Together with the hard-coded limitation, that bricks can actuall only connect to neighbors, this enforce the network to grow in a classical layer-structure.

#### Settings

- `max_synapse_sections`: Maximum number of synapse-sections, which are allowed to be allocated in the memory to limit the size and avoid that the whole available memory is filled up, because of a misconfiguration.

- `sign_neg`: average relation of negative synapses to positive synapses in the network (1.0 = all negative, 0.0 = nothing negative)

### Cluster-Templates

Cluster-templates describing, how the segments should be connected with each other.

```
version: 1
segments:
    input
        name: input
        out: -> central : test_input

    example_segment
        name: central
        out: test_output -> output1

    output
        name: output1
```

Each segment has to following form:

```
TYPE
    name: NAME
    out: SOURCE_BRICK -> TARGET_SEGMENT : TARGET_BRICK
```

`TYPE`

The type can either be `input` or `output`, which are predefined types for the input and output-data of the network. Inputs and outputs can not be directly connected with each other. The type can also have the name of a segment-templates. In this case the template with the name of the type is used to create the segment. There can be multiple segments with the same type.
The number of available input- and output-neurons in the input- and output-brick depending of the number in the derectly connected segments.

`NAME`

The name is for identification while connecting the bricks, so the name must be unique within the cluster.

Outputs `out`

Connect bricks of two segments with each other. Output-bricks don't have outgoing connections

`SOURCE_BRICK`

Name of an output-brick within the actual segment. If the current bricks is an input-brick, which value don't have to be set.

`TARGET_SEGMENT`

Name of the target-segment within the cluster.

`TARGET_BRICK`

Name of the target input-brick within the `TARGET_SEGMENT`. If the `TARGET_SEGMENT` is an output-segment, a `TARGET_BRICK` don't have to be set.
