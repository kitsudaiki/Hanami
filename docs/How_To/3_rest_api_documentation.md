# API documentation

!!! info

    This documentation was automatically created from the code to ensure consistency. Working alone on such a project with addtionally a high frequence in changing the API makes it nearly improssible to maintain this documentation manually. Beside this, it already saved me a huge amount of time, which I have available for the project itself instead.

!!! warning

    This documentation contains only the plain REST-API-endpoints. The workflow to upload files or interact with the Clusters over the websocket are not part of this documentation. [See instead](/How_To/4_websocket_workflow)
