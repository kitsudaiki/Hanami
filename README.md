# **IMPORTANT: This project is still an experimental prototype at the moment and NOT ready for productive usage.** 

There is still a huge bunch of known bugs and missing validations, which can break the backend. Even the documentation here is quite basic. Normally I absolutely dislike it to make something public, which has known bugs and other problems, but I simply don't wanted to wait longer for the open-sourcing of this project. Most of it will be fixed until [Version `0.2.0`](/#roadmap). Keep in mind, that this project is created by a single person in his spare time beside a 40h/week job. ;)

## Intro

Hanami-AI is an AI-as-a-Service project, based on a concept created by myself. It is written from scratch with a Backend in C++ with Web-frontend.

The actual prototype consists of:

- partially implementation of an own concept for an artificial neuronal network. It has no fixed connections between the nodes, but creates connections over time while learning. Additionally it doesn't need a normalization of input-values and this way it can also handle unknown data as input. This should make it flexible and efficient. The current state is extremely experimental.
- multi-user- and multi-project-support, so multiple-users can share the same physical host
- basic energy-optimization supporting the scheduling of threads of all components and changing the cpu-frequency based on workload
- basic monitoring of cpu-load
- Webfrontend with client-side rendering and SDK-library
- Websocket-connection to directly interact with the artificial neuronal networks
- CI-pipelines, Test-Tool, Docker-build-process and basic helm-chart to deploy the project on Kubernetes

## Roadmap

- [ ] improve documentation
- [ ] Open-API REST-documentation

- learning-process:
    - [ ] GPU-support
    - [ ] allow to use it as spiking-neuronal-network
    - [ ] remove strict layer-structure, which is still enforced by hard configuration at the moment
    - [ ] build 3-dimensional networks
    - [ ] add classical static neuronal networks

- [ ] Multi-Node-Setups

## This repository

This repository requires `git-lfs` to be able to check out images and binary objects.

Clone repo with:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:kitsudaiki/Hanami-AI.git
```

In case `git-lfs` while cloning and installed afterwards:

```
git lfs fetch --all
```

In case the repo was cloned without submodules initially:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive

## Contributing

I'm happy, if you find the project interesting enough to contribute code. In this case, please wait until version `0.2.0`, because there are many API- and Database-breaking changes on the project. Additionally until `0.2.0` I will also provide a Code-Styling-Guide (at least for the C++-backend).
