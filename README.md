**IMPORTANT: This project is still an experimental prototype at the moment and NOT ready for productive usage.** 

There is still a huge bunch of known bugs and missing validations, which can break the backend. Even the documentation here is quite basic. Normally I absolutely dislike it to make something public, which has known bugs and other problems, but I simply don't wanted to wait longer for the open-sourcing of this project. Most of it will be fixed until [Version `0.2.0`](/#roadmap). Keep in mind, that this project is created by a single person in his spare time beside a 40h/week job. ;)

## Intro

Hanami-AI is an AI-as-a-Service project, based on a concept created by myself. It is written from scratch with a Backend in C++ with Web-frontend.

The actual prototype consists of:

- partially implementation of an own concept for an artificial neuronal network. It has no fixed connections between the nodes, but creates connections over time while learning. Additionally it doesn't need a normalization of input-values and this way it can also handle unknown data as input. This should make it flexible and efficient. The current state is extremely experimental.
- multi-user- and multi-project-support, so multiple-users can share the same physical host
- basic energy-optimization supporting the scheduling of threads of all components and changing the cpu-frequency based on workload
- basic monitoring of cpu-load
- Webfrontend with client-side rendering and SDK-library
- Websocket-connection to directly interact with the artificial neuronal networks
- CI-pipelines, Test-Tool, Docker-build-process and basic helm-chart to deploy the project on Kubernetes

- Even it is quite basic for now, there are also some internal workflow and tasks of the single components described:

## Roadmap

- **0.1.0**
    - *content*: 
        - first prototype with basic feature-set

- **0.2.0**
    - *expected date*: Q1 2023
    - *content*: 
        - no new features but only improving the current state with:
            - bugfixes
            - additional validation
            - more documentation
            - ...

- **0.3.0**
    - *expected date*: end Q2 2023
    - *content*: 
        - complete implementation of the core-concept and further evaluation and improvement of the learning-process:
            - allow to use it as spiking-neuronal-network
            - remove strict layer-structure, which is still enforced by hard configuration at the moment
            - build 3-dimensional networks
        - further evaluation and improving of the core-process
        - add classical static neuronal networks with GPU-support

## Contributing

I'm happy, if you find the project interesting enough to contribute code. In this case, please wait until version `0.2.0`, because there are many API- and Database-breaking changes on the project. Additionally until `0.2.0` I will also provide a Code-Styling-Guide (at least for the C++-backend).
