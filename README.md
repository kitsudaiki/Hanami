# **IMPORTANT: This project is still an experimental prototype at the moment and NOT ready for productive usage.** 

There is still a huge bunch of known bugs and missing validations, which can break the backend. Even the documentation here is quite basic. Normally I absolutely dislike it to make something public, which has known bugs and other problems, but I simply don't wanted to wait longer for the open-sourcing of this project. Keep in mind, that this project is created by a single person in his spare time beside a 40h/week job. ;)

## Intro

Hanami-AI is an AI-as-a-Service project, based on a concept created by myself. It is written from scratch with a Backend in C++ with Web-frontend.

The actual prototype consists of:

- partially implementation of an own concept for an artificial neuronal network. It has no fixed connections between the nodes, but creates connections over time while learning. Additionally it doesn't need a normalization of input-values and this way it can also handle unknown data as input. This should make it flexible and efficient. The current state is extremely experimental.
- very experimental but working GPU-support with CUDA and OpenCL
- multi-user- and multi-project-support, so multiple-users can share the same physical host
- basic energy-optimization supporting the scheduling of threads of all components and changing the cpu-frequency based on workload
- basic monitoring of cpu-load
- Webfrontend with client-side rendering and SDK-library
- Websocket-connection to directly interact with the artificial neuronal networks
- CI-pipelines, Test-Tool, Docker-build-process and basic helm-chart to deploy the project on Kubernetes

## Documentation

- Installation-Guide to deploy HanamiAI on a kubernetes for testing:

- To get a first impression there is a first example-workflow via the dashboard:

- Even it is quite basic for now, there are also some internal workflow and tasks of the single components described:

- Many basic dependencies were created in context of this project. Here is an overview of all involved repositories:

## Roadmap

- **0.1.0**
    - first prototype with basic feature-set

- **0.2.0**
    - merge all involved repositories into the main-repository
    - internal restructures, primary for the GPU-support
    - experimental GPU-support wiht CUDA and OpenCL (disabled at the moment)
    - general minor improvements

- **0.3.0**
    - *desired date*: Q3 2023
    - *content*: 
        - complete implementation of the core-concept and further evaluation and improvement of the learning-process:
            - allow to use it as spiking-neuronal-network
            - remove strict layer-structure, which is still enforced by hard configuration at the moment
            - build 3-dimensional networks
            - re-add the old reduction-process again
        - further evaluation and improving of the core-process
        - make GPU-support usable

- **0.4.0**
    - *desired date*: Q4 2023
    - *content*: 
        - first Multi-Node-Setup
        - rework dashboard


## Issue-Overview

[Hanami-AI-Project](https://github.com/users/kitsudaiki/projects/9/views/4)

## This repository

This repository requires `git-lfs` to be able to check out images and binary objects.

Clone repo with:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:kitsudaiki/Hanami-AI.git
```

In case `git-lfs` while cloning and installed afterwards:

```
git lfs fetch --all
```

In case the repo was cloned without submodules initially:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```

For the OpenAPI-documentation the swagger-ui plugin for mkdocs is necessary:

```
pip3 install mkdocs-swagger-ui-tag
```
